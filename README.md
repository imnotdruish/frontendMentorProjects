# Projects for Frontend Mentor Challenges

These are all of my solutions for the Frontend Mentor Challenges at frontendmentor.io. I have decided to work through all the challenges to help improve my skills with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and API calls. I have started with the easiest level of Challenges and will progress through them from Newbie to Guru. All challenges will have a live version hosted on Netlify.app as well as the code repository here. THis will be a long projects as there are over 60 Challenges in the free sections, and I may continue to progress into the Premium subscription Challenges once I am done with these free ones.

## Progress

I am currently throught all but one of the HTML/CSS Newbie challenges, but they are all individual repositories at this time. I will be migrating them into this single repository and updating the live verisons on Netlify with the base directories. This may take some time to complete, so in the meantime, the original repositories will be available until the migration has be completed.
